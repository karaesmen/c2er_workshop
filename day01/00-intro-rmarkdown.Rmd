# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. R Markdown is a formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html>.

You can use it to take notes and run code. For example, you can write your name on the line below. Try it: 


```{r}
# You can write code in chunks that look like this.
# This chunk uses some code from base R to plot a data set.
# To run the code click the Green play button to the right. Try it!
plot(JohnsonJohnson)
```

Good job! The results of a code chunk will appear beneath the chunk. You can click the x above the results to make them go away, but let's not do that.

You can open a new R Markdown by going to **File > New File > R Markdown**.

## Adding chunks

To add a new chunk, press *Cmd+Option+I* (*Ctrl+Alt+I* on Windows), or click the *Insert* button at the top of this document, then select *R*. 
Try making a code chunk below:



Good job! For now, you should place all of your *R code* inside of code chunks.

```{r}
# You can click the downward facing arrow to the left of the play button to run
# every chunk above the current code chunk. This is useful if the code in your
# chunk depends on the code in previous chunks. For example, if you use an
# object or data set made in a previous chunk.

```


What's the sum of 5493 and 9345? You can simply use the `+` sign.
Create a code chunk and give it a try!
